# Project Overview

Project from Udacity to improve the skills in Jasmine test enviroment. The tasks designed can be found in the feedreader.js file.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## The App

This app is a feed news which depends basically of a list of URLs. Some of the tests developed here are going to use Asynchronous request!
